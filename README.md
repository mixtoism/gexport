Backup and Publish links to Spreadsheet scripts using Google Scripts

The presented scripts are designed for copying files from a shared folder into your own and generate your own links for download in a Spreadsheet. The scripts work both with your unit and with Team Drives, and are designed to be used once a 1:1 copy is already done to keep your files updated with the source. If there are too many files to be copied it is likely that quota will be reached soon. But in the next run the script will continue from the last copied file and sync circularly.

The lastest version only requires the syncv2.js script
